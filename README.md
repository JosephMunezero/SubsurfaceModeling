•  Subsurface porosity is deduced from seismic trace data using deep learning
•  Standard deviation and absolute error are quantified from multiple realizations 
•  Statistically, uncertainty is evaluated; a result confidence profile is provided
•  For a superior result, an innovative weight-averaging ensemble method is proposed
